I need to make a code that can be used generally and not specific to my project 
I want to use QIIME commands but instead of changing and writing a new code for the inputs and outputs that are specfic to 1 project

To do this I plan to make text file with a shabang in order to make the QIIME commands work for any data 
The user would only need to have to assign the variables with the file that they would like to use as an input/output
My program would define a variable using $1, $2, $3, etc 
Then when the user decides to run my program they will be able to use the command 'sh' followed by the textfile that contains my program 
The user will then provide/assign the variable with the files that they would like to use 
Since some of the outputs of one QIIME command block are used as the input for another QIIME block, I think that I will have to write several text files
I could write the first few QIIME command blocks in one file and then store the outputit in a directory which I can later call to be used as input for another command

While the above strategy could work, a possible better way of doing this would be assigning flags
By doing this I am not limited to only 9 variables and I can call an output from one qiime block to be used as the input of another
I can also put different ouputs in new directories in order to organize it all/ make it user friendly when you want to retrace your steps 
I can start small and do qiime block individually and then at the end potentially put all the variables in a vars file
For example a sample code is:
In=""
Out=""	
while getopts "i:o:" opt; do
	case $opt in
		i) In="$OPTARG"
		;;
		o) Out="$OPTARG"
		;;
	esac
done
source /u/local/Modules/default/init/bash
module load python/anaconda2
source activate qiime2-2019.1

mkdir output-emp-single-end-sequences

qiime tools import \
  --type EMPSingleEndSequences \
  --input-path ${In} \
  --output-path ${Out}/emp-single-end-sequences.qza
  
The output should give single end sequences stored in a new directory 

I can later daisy chain the commands together
