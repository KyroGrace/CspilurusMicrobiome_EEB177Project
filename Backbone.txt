# This program will take several files that will be "velcroed" thanks to the presence of feature ID and sample ID connected to each bacteria and fish sample, respictively
# Inputs to this program will include:
## a file that lists all the unique sequences of 16S in all the samples
## a file that lists the abundance of each unique sequence in each sample
## a file that has the metadata for each sample 
###(i.e. sample number, species, catch site, etc)
# We will then utilize quiime to process all this information to make a graph showing diversity
# The following is the rough draft of the backbone for the program with comments throughout:

# First you must make a directory and enter it
mkdir Cspilurus_16S_diversity
cd Cspilurus_16S_diversity

# Before you continue you also want to make sure that you can access file containing your metadata 
# Note that the data should be in a .tsv file
## For Excel you can copy the file from your Desktop to a directory using these commands:
pwd
# use above command to get path of this directory you are in/ want to copy the file to
###in another shell window enter the following commands:
cd ~/Desktop
cd EEB177_Project
ls
# use the above command to find the file in this folder that you would like to copy to your hoffman account
scp #insert filename here.tsv# c177-04@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/u/home/Cspilurus_metadata

# Now you import and upload the sequences
mkdir Cspilurus_metadata
cd Cspilurus_metadata

# Data should be in barcodes.fastq.gz file
## For the Excel you will need to copy the file from your Desktop to the directory using...
## these commands:
pwd
# obtain the path in this directory to copy the file to
## open another shell window and enter these commands:
cd ~/Desktop
cd EEB177_Project
ls
# use this command to obtain the file you want to copy from this folder to your hoffman
scp #insert filename here.barcodes.fastq.gz# c177-04@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/u/home/Cspilurus_sequences

## the following is for "sequences.fastq.gz"
# Data should be in sequences.fastq.gz file
## For the Excel you will need to copy the file from your Desktop to the directory using...
## these commands:
pwd
# obtain the path in this directory to copy the file to
## open another shell window and enter these commands:
cd ~/Desktop
cd EEB177_Project
ls
# use this command to obtain the file you want to copy from this folder to your hoffman
scp #insert filename here.sequences.fastq.gz# c177-04@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/u/home/Cspilurus_sequen

# So now that we have all the 3 files that we uploaded to the terminal above, we want to assign sequences to samples by using the qiime 2 command EMPSingleEndSequences
#First lets assign variables so that this code can serve as a backbone to run any sequences!
	#1 = Cspilurus_sequences
	#2 = emp-single-end-sequences.qza
	#3 = sample-metadata.tsv
	#4 = demux.qza
	#5 = rep-seqs-dada2.qza
	#6 = table-dada2.qza
 	#7 = stats-dada2.qza
 	#8 = rep-seqs.qza
 	#9 = table.qza
 	#10 = aligned-re-seqs.qza
 	#11 = masked-aligned-re-seqs.qza
 	#12 = unrooted-tree.qza
 	#13 = rooted-tree.qza
#And then we use the code below:
qiime tools import \
  --type EMPSingleEndSequences \
  --input-path 1 \
  --output-path 2
#We also want to assign a barcode to the samples and so will run another qiime 2 command
qiime demux emp-single \
  --i-seqs 2 \
  --m-barcodes-file 3 \
  --m-barcodes-column BarcodeSequence \
  --o-per-sample-sequences 4 \
  --o-error-correction-details demux-details.qza
# The next command is for the user to be able to visualize the demultiplex data
# By following this next command the user will be given different information about the sample sequences, which include:
## number of sequences per sample
## distribution of quality of the sequence	
qiime demux summarize \
  --i-data 4 \
  --o-visualization demux.qzv
  
# Now we want to detect and correct errors in amplicon sequence data
# the code will trim and truncate the sequences to remove low quality regions
qiime dada2 denoise-single \
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs 4 \
  --p-trim-left 0 \
  --p-trunc-len 120 \
  --o-representative-sequences 5 \
  --o-table 6 \
  --o-denoising-stats 7
qiime metadata tabulate \
  --m-input-file 7 \
  --o-visualization stats-dada2.qzv
mv 5 rep-seqs.qza
mv 6 table.qza

#In order to visualize the results of the filtered data, you must do the following commands:
qiime feature-table summarize \
  --i-table 8 \
  --o-visualization table.qzv \
  --m-sample-metadata-file 3
qiime feature-table tabulate-seqs \
  --i-data 8 \
  --o-visualization rep-seqs.qzv
  
#To generate you must run the following code:
qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree \
  --i-sequences 8 \
  --o-alignment 10 \
  --o-masked-alignment 11 \
  --o-tree 12 \
  --o-rooted-tree 13
  
#Now you want to generate alpha and beta diversity analysis
qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic \
